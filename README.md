### Hi there 👋

I'm Kaheon Kim and I'm going to gain my bachelor's degree in mathematical Science and Industrial Engineering at UNIST in this August. 

In the same period, I will matriculate at the University of Notre Dame to pursue my Ph.D in ACMS(Applied Computational Math and Statistics), specifically in Statistics.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I'm interested in Mathematical Data-driven Model for learning dynamical systems.
- 🙋‍♂️ I'm an undergraduate student in UNIST, majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Industrial engineering.
- 🪖 I’m currently on academic leave due to military service.
- 📫 How to reach me: kdkam12@unist.ac.kr
- 🎹 In my free time, I enjoy taking a walk and playing piano.
